// The SCORM 2004 4th Edition control documents, inlined for the browser build.
//
// imsmanifest.xml names five of these in its xsi:schemaLocation and a content
// package traditionally carries them at its root, so they ship inside the zip
// (see the scorm-export package's schemas/VENDORED.md).  Listed one by one
// rather than globbed because they come from a workspace package, where Vite's
// import.meta.glob does not reliably reach.
//
// This is ~88 KB of string, which is why the export path is loaded on demand —
// see downloadScormPackage's caller.
