/**
 * Wraps an `async` Passport callback so a rejection can never escape.
 *
 * Passport's callbacks are callback-style: they signal completion by calling
 * `done`, and Passport does not await their return value. Handing Passport an
 * `async` function therefore produces a floating promise — any throw becomes an
 * unhandled rejection, which (since Node 15) terminates the process. A single
 * malformed OAuth profile takes down the whole server.
 *
 * This is the auth-path equivalent of `queryLoggedIn` in
 * `middleware/queryMiddleware.ts`: it guarantees that every failure reaches one
 * error path instead of relying on each call site to remember a try/catch.
 *
 * Errors are reported through `done(err)`, which is what Passport expects and
 * what routes the failure into normal Express error handling.
 *
 * The returned function reports the same `.length` as the handler it wraps.
 * Passport dispatches on arity -- see `authenticator.js`, which calls
 * `layer(req, user, done)` only when `layer.length === 3` and otherwise calls
 * `layer(user, done)` -- so a wrapper using rest parameters (`.length === 0`)
 * would silently shift every argument by one.
