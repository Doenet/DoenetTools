# Legacy content migration

Copies every user's Portfolio and Course content from legacy.doenet.org into
their account on the new doenet.org, under a private "Copied Legacy Content"
folder. See `legacy-content-migration-plan.md` (in the legacy repo root) for
the full plan and decisions.

What each user gets:

- `Copied Legacy Content/Portfolio/` — their portfolio activities.
- `Copied Legacy Content/Courses/<course>/<sections...>` — every course they
  own (each co-owner gets an independent copy), with the legacy section
  structure reproduced as folders.
- Single-page activities become Documents; multi-page activities and banks
  become Problem Sets with their pages flattened in document order.
- Everything is private, licensed CCDUAL, DoenetML version 0.6.
- Referenced images are uploaded to the media bucket, created as image
  content (license CC-BY) in the same folder as the referencing activity,
  and `<image>` tags in document sources are rewritten to the new form with
  attribution matching the image row, e.g.
  `<image source="doenet:<id>" imageName="..." authorName="..." licenseCodes="CC-BY" />`
  (requires @doenet/standalone >= 0.6.15 for 0.6 docs).

## Prerequisites

- The target database has the `imageContent` migration (PR #2993) applied and
  seeded licenses / doenetmlVersions (0.6 must exist and not be removed).
- The legacy data is on disk (see "Refreshing the legacy data" below):
  `~/legacy-migration/input/legacy-data.sql` and
  `~/legacy-migration/input/media/` (extracted from media.tgz).
- `MEDIA_S3_*` env vars point at the target media bucket, `DATABASE_URL` at
  the target database (apps/api/.env for local dev).

## Stages

All commands run from `apps/api`. Artifacts land in
`scripts/legacy-migration/build/` (gitignored).

```bash
# 0. load the dump into a scratch MySQL database (drops + recreates it)
scripts/legacy-migration/00-load-scratch.sh

# 1. read scratch DB + media tree -> build/model.json + extract-report.md
npx tsx scripts/legacy-migration/01-extract.ts

# review build/extract-report.md before continuing

# 2. upload referenced images to S3 -> build/image-map.json (idempotent)
npx tsx scripts/legacy-migration/02-upload-images.ts

# 3. dry-run the import (no writes; journals to id-map.dry-run.tsv)
npx tsx scripts/legacy-migration/03-import.ts --dry-run

# 4. import one test user, check it in the UI
npx tsx scripts/legacy-migration/03-import.ts --user=someone@example.com

# 5. full import (journals to build/id-map.tsv; re-run to resume)
npx tsx scripts/legacy-migration/03-import.ts

# 6. rewrite cross-activity <ref> links to the migrated copies' ids
#    (requires the completed journal; in-place UPDATE, idempotent)
npx tsx scripts/legacy-migration/03b-rewrite-refs.ts

# 7. verify
npx tsx scripts/legacy-migration/04-verify.ts
```

The rewritten links rely on `@doenet/standalone` >= 0.6.16, whose default
`linkSettings` targets this site's routes (/activityViewer, /documentEditor;
DoenetML#1501) — that default reaches every render path uniformly, including
problem sets via `@doenet/assignment-viewer`, so the app passes no
`linkSettings` itself. `<copy uri="doenet:...">` transclusions are not
migrated (counted in build/ref-rewrite-report.md).

Writing to a non-local database additionally requires
`--yes-target=<db-host>` on 03-import.

### Flags

- `--dry-run` — plan + report everything, write nothing (02 and 03).
- `--user=<email>` — restrict to one legacy user (01 is unaffected; 02/03/04 honor it).
- `--yes-target=<host>` — confirm writing to a non-local DATABASE_URL host.

### Environment overrides

- `LEGACY_SCRATCH_DATABASE_URL` (default `mysql://root:root@127.0.0.1:3307/legacy_migration`)
- `LEGACY_MEDIA_DIR` (default `~/legacy-migration/input/media`)
- `LEGACY_BUILD_DIR` (default `scripts/legacy-migration/build`)

## Idempotency / resume

Every created row is appended to `build/id-map.tsv` _before_ the next create.
Re-running 03-import skips journaled items, so a crashed run resumes where it
stopped. If a user already has a "Copied Legacy Content" folder that is not
in the journal, that user is skipped with an error (protects against
double-importing with a lost journal). 02-upload-images re-verifies existing
map entries with a HEAD request before skipping them.

`build/id-map.tsv` is also the deliverable mapping legacy ids to new-site
short ids (kind: user / folder / activity / page / image), for back-links and
user support.

## Running inside the deployed container (dev3 / prod)

The deployed image contains the compiled stages at `dist/scripts/legacy-migration/`,
and the task environment already provides `DATABASE_URL` and `MEDIA_S3_*`. Only
stages 02–04 run there; extract (00–01) runs on a workstation and its
`model.json` is portable.

1. Locally: upload `model.json` and `media.tgz` to a **private** S3 bucket and
   mint presigned GET URLs (e.g. `aws s3 presign s3://<bucket>/<key> --expires-in 3600`).
2. From the `infra/` directory (the script resolves `dev3.aws` and
   `scripts/login.sh` against the current directory): `scripts/exec.sh -s dev3`
   (or `-s prod`); pick the api service (doenet-FARGATE). Requires jq and
   session-manager-plugin locally.
3. Inside the container:

```bash
# The runtime image has no CA store, so curl's TLS fails (error 77) until
# ca-certificates is installed. The exec session runs as root; the install is
# ephemeral (redo it after any task restart).
apt-get update && apt-get install -y ca-certificates

mkdir -p /tmp/legacy-migration/build && cd /tmp/legacy-migration
curl -fo media.tgz '<presigned media.tgz url>' && tar -xzf media.tgz
curl -fo build/model.json '<presigned model.json url>'
export LEGACY_MEDIA_DIR=/tmp/legacy-migration/media
export LEGACY_BUILD_DIR=/tmp/legacy-migration/build
cd /DoenetTools/apps/api
node dist/prisma/seed.js                # seeds versions (0.6 -> 0.6.17), licenses
node dist/scripts/legacy-migration/02-upload-images.js
node dist/scripts/legacy-migration/03-import.js --dry-run
node dist/scripts/legacy-migration/03-import.js --user=<email> --yes-target=<db-host>
node dist/scripts/legacy-migration/03-import.js --yes-target=<db-host>
node dist/scripts/legacy-migration/03b-rewrite-refs.js --yes-target=<db-host>
node dist/scripts/legacy-migration/04-verify.js
```

(`03-import` prints `Target database: <host>...` and refuses until the same
host is passed via `--yes-target`.)

4. Immediately copy `build/id-map.tsv` and the reports off the container —
   `/tmp` is ephemeral and a redeploy or scale-to-zero wipes it, and the
   id-map is both the resume journal and the mapping deliverable. Presign a
   PUT URL locally (boto3 `generate_presigned_url("put_object", ...)`) and
   `curl -X PUT --upload-file build/id-map.tsv '<url>'` from the container.
5. Delete the uploaded inputs from S3 afterwards (they contain user data).

## Refreshing the legacy data

```bash
# database (any host that can reach the UMN MySQL):
mysqldump -h mysql-prod5.oit.umn.edu -u csedoenetprod -p \
  --single-transaction --skip-lock-tables \
  --default-character-set=utf8mb4 --set-gtid-purged=OFF \
  cse_doenet_prod \
  user course course_role course_user course_content pages link_pages support_files \
  > ~/legacy-data.sql

# media (on the legacy web host):
cd /var/www/html/legacy.doenet.org && tar -czf ~/media.tgz media

# then transfer both into ~/legacy-migration/input/ and extract media.tgz there
```

## Tests

```bash
npx vitest run scripts/legacy-migration
```
