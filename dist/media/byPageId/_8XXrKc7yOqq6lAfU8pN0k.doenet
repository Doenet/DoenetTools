I create a link from this file to the linked to file...
It's already open so I copy-paste the path.  This address was copied right before?after? the saved version Save2

<ref createButton="true" uri="doenet:doenetId=ASRLj3Ql25UD8pAKNG7H2">click me!</ref>

<p>When the button is clicked, it goes to a page that says "assignment is not assigned."  From this page I go back to the main Doenet menu and reopen this file to keep working.  The other file has been open the whole time...</p>

<p>just navigated here using the back browser arrows from the linked to file.  Now, I'll go back and forth with the link several times.  When I click the link it tends to freeze for a few minutes I've noticed.  I'll see if waiting works and then close and reload.</p>
