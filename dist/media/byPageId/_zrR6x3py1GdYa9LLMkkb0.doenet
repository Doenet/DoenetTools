  <alert>Part 1:</alert>
  You've computed some prime factorizations, but only for small examples.
  How do we <alert>know</alert> with 100\% certainty that there is no
  colossally large number such that we get two different factorizations,
  breaking all of mathematics as we know it?
</p>
<p>
  Well, that's what the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic tells us!
    We know with absolute certainty due to the following result.
    In the first video, we clearly state the result and I give some
    advice on how to go about watching these videos, or reading
    proofs in math text books or online.

  <alert>Part 2:</alert>
  Just like when we proved the division algorithm, we'll start by showing that the object we're interested (in this case the prime factorization of our number) always exists. This is a fairly straight-forward induction argument, and only takes a couple minutes to run through. This is our first example of <em>strong induction</em> though, so take a minute to make sure you understand the difference in the argument from the case for the division algorithm.

  <alert>Part 3:</alert>
  Finally, we get to the trickier part of proving the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. Next we establish that prime factorization is always unique (up to the order of factors).
  This is a <ref uri="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction">proof by contradiction</ref>. You can read the logical underpinnings of this technique on Wikipedia if you're unfamiliar with it, and I'd be happy to discuss it with you as well! (You can briefly read about how the existence of contradictions threatened all of axiomatic mathematics in the early 1900s, if you're interested. It's one of my favorite eras of mathematics.)
