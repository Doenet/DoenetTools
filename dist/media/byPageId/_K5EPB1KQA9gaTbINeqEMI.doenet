I create a link from this file to the linked to file...
It's already open so I copy-paste the path.  This address was copied right before?after? the saved version Save2

<ref createButton="true" uri="doenet:doenetId=ASRLj3Ql25UD8pAKNG7H2">click me!</ref>

<p>When the button is clicked, it goes to a page that says "assignment is not assigned."  From this page I go back to the main Doenet menu and reopen this file to keep working.  The other file has been open the whole time...</p>

<p>just navigated here using the back browser arrows from the linked to file.  Now, I'll go back and forth with the link several times.  When I click the link it tends to freeze for a few minutes I've noticed.  I'll see if waiting works and then close and reload.</p>

<p>nevermind three, using the back arrow from the error page once caused Doenet to crash. Interestingly, when I got the pages unresponsive note it showed two doenet instances but I only had one tab open...So now, I'll try using the breadcrumbs to navigate  back to the linked to file.</p>

<p>bug acheived! when I navigated back to the linked-to file using the breadcrumbs, the "linked to" file was overwritten (and for some reason with an earlier version of) with the "linked from" file.  I took a screen shot and linked it below.  It also made the editor pane act very strange.  I saved the overwritten file as version Save4.  If you click on version Save3 it still has the bunny.</p>

<p>bug found save1 for this file</p>
