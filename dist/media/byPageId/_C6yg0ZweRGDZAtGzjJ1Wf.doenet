<p>The volume of a cell is given by the function <m>$p_t =<copy prop="formula" tname="ff" /></m> <m>\mu {\rm m}^3</m> from <m>t=$lb </m> to <m>t=$ub </m> seconds. What is the average volume of the cell during this time frame? If rounding, be sure to include at least <m>5</m> significant digits.

<solution>

<p>
To solve this, we need to evaluate the integral <m>\displaystyle \int_{$lb}^{$ub} ($ff) dt </m> and divide by <m>\Delta t = $ub - $lb =$deltat</m> seconds.
</p>

<p><me>\frac{1}{$deltat} \int_{$lb}^{$ub} ($ff) dt  =  \frac{1}{$deltat} \left($antideriv_ff \right) \Bigg|_{$lb}^{$ub}  = \frac{$intfeval}{$deltat} </me>
</p>


<p>The average volume is <m>\displaystyle $aveval </m>  <m>\mu {\rm m}^3</m>.</p>
