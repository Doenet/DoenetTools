<!--I do not currently understand the extract component-->


<p>What is your favorite color?</p>
<textInput name="userColor"></textInput>

<!--The following does not do anything, and causes an error.-->
<!--<p>Your favorite color is: <extract>userColor</extract></p>-->

<!--However, if you use copy this works...Remember, inside copy you do not use the $ in front of the name of your target-->

<p>Your favorite color is...:  <copy prop = "value" tname = "userColor" />.  Nice choice!</p>
