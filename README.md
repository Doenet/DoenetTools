# Welcome to Doenet!

The Distributed Open Education Network (Doenet) is an open data-driven educational technology platform designed to measure and share student interactions with web pages. It includes tools for authoring interactive educational content, including our custom DoenetML markup language, and conducting educational research using the content. Our ultimate goal is to provide research-based tools to help instructors and learners discover the most effective content. Simply put, Doenet gives teachers complete flexibility over their educational content and gives them power of anonymized student data to track learning outcomes. With Doenet, we hope to help teachers teach better and students learn better.

Although we are still in the early stages, we are excited to introduce Doenet and illustrate the richly interactive activities that one can author with it.

For more background and information on the Doenet project, see this [MAA DUE Point](https://www.mathvalues.org/masterblog/reimagining-online-mathematics) article.

## Getting started

Three ways to get a development environment, easiest first. Full instructions —
including running the tests and opening a pull request — are in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

**1. GitHub Codespaces.** Nothing to install; everything runs in the browser.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/Doenet/DoenetApps)

**2. Dev container on your machine.** Docker is the only prerequisite — the
container brings its own Node, MySQL, S3 mock, and Chrome for the Cypress
suites. Open the repository in VS Code and choose **Reopen in Container**, or:

```bash
npx @devcontainers/cli up --workspace-folder .
```

**3. The toolchain on your machine.** Node 24 and Docker, for the fastest inner
loop:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Doenet/DoenetApps.git
cd DoenetApps
npm install
npm run setup     # creates apps/api/.env, starts MySQL, migrates and seeds
npm run dev       # app :8000, api :3000, blog :4321
```

However you start it, the app is at http://localhost:8000 and the blog is at
`/blog` on the same origin, matching production.

## Repository Structure

This repository is an npm workspace monorepo. Packages are organized into two directories:

- **`apps/`** — runnable applications (each has a dev server or build output intended to be deployed or run directly)
- **`packages/`** — shared libraries and internal tooling consumed by the apps

### Apps

| Package    | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apps/api` | Express REST API and database layer (Prisma + MySQL). The backend for the platform.                                                                                             |
| `apps/app` | React SPA — the main Doenet web application. Communicates with `api` via `/api/*`.                                                                                              |
| `apps/web` | Astro-based static site. Currently houses the Doenet blog, but is intended to grow into the full public-facing static portion of the website (landing pages, about page, etc.). |

### Packages

| Package                  | Description                                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `packages/shared`        | Utility functions and TypeScript types shared between `api` and `app`. Must be built before either app. |
| `packages/e2e-tests`     | Cypress end-to-end tests. Requires both dev servers running.                                            |
| `packages/eslint-config` | Internal shared ESLint configuration used to lint each package                                          |
| `packages/load-tests`    | Locust load tests for analyzing maximum traffic capacity and bottlenecks.                               |
