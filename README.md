# Welcome to Doenet!

The Distributed Open Education Network (Doenet) is an open data-driven educational technology platform designed to measure and share student interactions with web pages. It includes tools for authoring interactive educational content, including our custom DoenetML markup language, and conducting educational research using the content. Our ultimate goal is to provide research-based tools to help instructors and learners discover the most effective content. Simply put, Doenet gives teachers complete flexibility over their educational content and gives them power of anonymized student data to track learning outcomes. With Doenet, we hope to help teachers teach better and students learn better.

Although we are still in the early stages, we are excited to introduce Doenet and illustrate the richly interactive activities that one can author with it.

For more background and information on the Doenet project, see this [MAA DUE Point](https://www.mathvalues.org/masterblog/reimagining-online-mathematics) article.

## Dev Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 24+
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for the MySQL database)

### Steps

**1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Doenet/DoenetTools.git
cd DoenetTools
```

**2. Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

**3. Create the `.env` files**

```bash
npm run setup
```

This copies:

- `apps/api/.env.example` to `apps/api/.env`
- `apps/web/.env.example` to `apps/web/.env`

The API defaults work for local development, but edit as needed (e.g. change `DATABASE_HOST`, `DATABASE_PORT`, or `DATABASE_PASSWORD` if your MySQL setup differs — and update `DATABASE_URL` to match). The web env sets the Astro header logo link target used in local development.

**4. Start the database**

```bash
docker compose --env-file apps/api/.env up -d
```

Wait until the MySQL container shows `(healthy)` in `docker container ls` before continuing.

**5. Setup the database tables**

```bash
npm run db:setup
```

This creates the required database tables and seeds them with minimal data.

**6. Start the dev servers**

All dev processes can be started together with a single command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts:

- Shared package watcher
- Express API → http://localhost:3000
- React SPA → http://localhost:8000 (proxies `/api/*` to the API and `/blog/*` to Astro)
- Astro site → http://localhost:4321

This command first builds `shared` once, then starts its watch process alongside
the app, API, and web dev servers.

For local development, use the app origin for both frontends:

- app pages → `http://localhost:8000/...`
- blog pages → `http://localhost:8000/blog/...`

Alternatively, run each in a separate terminal if needed:

```bash
npm run dev --workspace @doenet-tools/shared   # Shared package watcher
npm run dev --workspace @doenet-tools/api   # Express API
npm run dev --workspace @doenet-tools/app   # React SPA
npm run dev --workspace @doenet-tools/web   # Astro site
```

## Repository Structure

This repository is an npm workspace monorepo. Packages are organized into two directories:

- **`apps/`** — runnable applications (each has a dev server or build output intended to be deployed or run directly)
- **`packages/`** — shared libraries and internal tooling consumed by the apps

### Apps

| Package    | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apps/api` | Express REST API and database layer (Prisma + MySQL). The backend for the platform.                                                                                             |
| `apps/app` | React SPA — the main Doenet web application. Communicates with `api` via `/api/*`.                                                                                              |
| `apps/web` | Astro-based static site. Currently houses the Doenet blog, but is intended to grow into the full public-facing static portion of the website (landing pages, about page, etc.). |

### Packages

| Package                  | Description                                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `packages/shared`        | Utility functions and TypeScript types shared between `api` and `app`. Must be built before either app. |
| `packages/e2e-tests`     | Cypress end-to-end tests. Requires both dev servers running.                                            |
| `packages/eslint-config` | Internal shared ESLint configuration used to lint each package                                          |
| `packages/load-tests`    | Locust load tests for analyzing maximum traffic capacity and bottlenecks.                               |
