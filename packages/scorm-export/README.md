# doenet-scorm-export

Backs the "Download SCORM" button on doenet.org: wraps a single DoenetML
activity in an LMS-ready SCORM 2004 package, **without** the PreTeXt
toolchain. The SCORM runtime intelligence is reused from PreTeXt as two
verbatim-vendored JavaScript files (see `vendor/VENDORED.md`).

## Layout

Building a package is pure string substitution plus a zip, so that work lives
in `src/index.js` with no `fs`, no `child_process`, and no DOM — it runs
unchanged in Node and in the browser. Two thin adapters call it:

| Caller                                     | Loads the constant files with |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `build.mjs` (this package's CLI)           | `readFileSync`                |
| `apps/app/src/utils/scorm.ts` (the button) | Vite's `?raw` imports         |

Both hand those files to `buildScormPackage(assets, options)` as strings, which
is why `vendor/` stays the single verbatim copy of the GPL sources rather than
being duplicated into a generated module.

## Try it

```sh
node build.mjs sample/sample.doenet --title "Sample Doenet Activity"
```

This writes `dist/sample-scorm.zip`. Upload that zip to an LMS as a SCORM
package (Canvas: Settings → Navigation → enable SCORM, then SCORM → Upload;
Moodle: add a "SCORM package" activity; Brightspace/Blackboard: content
upload menus). The page shows the activity plus a "Submit Assignment"
button; scores flow to the LMS gradebook.

## What's in a package

A SCORM package here is just six static files in a flat zip:

| File                    | Role                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `imsmanifest.xml`       | Minimal SCORM 2004 4th Ed. manifest: one item, one SCO, launch `index.html`     |
| `index.html`            | Chrome-free shell: `div[data-component="doenet"]` wrapping the activity iframe  |
| `activity.html`         | The iframe content: DoenetML source + `@doenet/standalone` viewer from CDN      |
| `ptx_scorm_events.js`   | Vendored SCORM bridge (LMS API discovery, scoring, state save/restore, submit)  |
| `lti_iframe_resizer.js` | Vendored SPLICE `lti.frameResize` handler so the iframe fits its content        |
| `lz-string.min.js`      | `lz-string` npm dep, copied in at build time; compresses state for suspend_data |

Only `activity.html` (DoenetML) and the title/id substitutions vary per
activity; everything else is constant. The two `ptx_*`/`lti_*` files are
vendored (see `vendor/VENDORED.md`); `lz-string.min.js` comes from the pinned
`lz-string` npm dependency, not from `vendor/`.

## How scoring works at runtime

1. The LMS launches `index.html` in an iframe and exposes the SCORM API
   (`window.API_1484_11` or `window.API`) on a parent window.
2. `activity.html`'s viewer has `data-doenet-message-parent="true"`, so it
   speaks SPLICE to its parent: `SPLICE.getState` on load (state restore)
   and `SPLICE.reportScoreAndState` on each answer (score in [0,1] plus a
   state blob encoding the student's work).
3. `ptx_scorm_events.js` in `index.html` translates those messages into
   SCORM calls: `cmi.interactions.*` records, `cmi.score.scaled/raw`, and
   completion status. The Doenet state blob is compressed (lz-string) into
   `cmi.suspend_data` — the manifest declares SCORM 2004 4th Edition for its
   64,000-char `suspend_data` limit — so both score and state persist
   server-side and restore on a fresh LMS launch (localStorage is kept only
   as a same-device cache). A size guard drops the state blob, falling back to
   localStorage, if it would ever overflow the budget.
4. "Submit Assignment" commits the final grade; the attempt is finalized
   when the student leaves the page (this ordering is a hard-won Blackboard
   requirement — see the comments in the vendored file).

## Debugging

`debug/size-probe.html` is a passive diagnostic that logs, to the browser
console: the size of each state blob Doenet emits and what the LMS actually
returned in `cmi.suspend_data` on launch (`[DOENET-SIZE-PROBE] …`), and each
`lti.frameResize` — the height reported, the height applied to the activity
iframe, and whether `index.html` overflows the box the LMS gave it
(`[DOENET-RESIZE-PROBE] …`; the "OUTER frame overflows" clause means the
scrollbar is the LMS player's, not ours). It is **not** part of a normal
package. Pass `--debug` to inline it into `index.html`:

```sh
node build.mjs sample/sample.doenet --debug
```

The file count is unchanged (it is inlined, not added as a separate file);
without `--debug` the package contains no trace of it.

## Notes and remaining limits

- Only single documents can be exported. A package is one SCO wrapping one
  DoenetML source in one iframe, so problem sets and sequences would need a
  different manifest and a different shell; the button is hidden for them.
- Keep the id stable across re-exports of the same activity: it keys the
  student's saved score and state in the LMS and in localStorage. The website
  passes the activity's `contentId` so renames don't orphan student work.
- The viewer loads from `cdn.jsdelivr.net`. The website pins the activity's
  own `doenetmlVersion`; from the CLI, pass `--doenet-version`. A fully
  offline package would need the standalone viewer bundled into the zip.
- The DoenetML source is injected into `activity.html` at runtime from a JS
  string literal with every `<` escaped, so a source containing `</script>`
  can't terminate the enclosing element — there is no source this rejects.
- Zips use a fixed timestamp, so re-exporting an unchanged activity produces
  the same bytes rather than embedding the build time.
- The vendored files are GPL (v2 or v3) from PreTeXt — preserve
  `vendor/VENDORED.md`, don't edit the copies, and pull upstream fixes by
  re-copying (instructions in that file).

## DOM contract with the vendored bridge

`ptx_scorm_events.js` expects: an element `div[data-component="doenet"]`
with the activity id, containing the iframe whose `contentWindow` sends the
SPLICE messages, all inside `<main>` (where the submit button is appended).
`index.html` provides exactly this; if you restructure it, keep those
invariants.
