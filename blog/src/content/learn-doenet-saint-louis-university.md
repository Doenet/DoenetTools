During our November 7-8 Doenet workshop, participants built classroom-ready activities featuring instant answer checking, interactive graphs, and randomized problems - all designed to give students immediate feedback as they work in a classroom setting.

The hands-on format allowed participants to focus deeply on their specific course needs, with individualized support from facilitators throughout the development process. Each participant completed a polished activity ready for immediate classroom use, with several planning to deploy their work as early as the following semester.

The final show-and-tell session showcased what participants were able to accomplish in just two days. One of the examples worth mentioning is the interactive Mean Value Theorem themed activity featuring dynamic graphs that respond to student input, built-in answer checking, and a carefully designed set of problems, designed by Daniel Kang. Students working through this activity can explore the theorem visually while receiving immediate feedback on their responses, transforming what's traditionally a challenging calculus concept into an engaging, interactive experience.

Participants left the workshop not just with technical skills, but with concrete materials ready to
enhance student learning in their courses.
