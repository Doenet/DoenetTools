Challenger: Anurag Katyal is an avid Doenet user, who enjoys creating problems for other people.

Understanding fractions is a common issue in building number sense for students. What does a fraction mean? How do we add fractions, and why does it work? How do we compare fractions? We’d love to have more activities to help our students build conceptual understanding of fractions!
